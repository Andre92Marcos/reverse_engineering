A buffer overflow exploit consists in passing enough data to a buffer that it will fill the memory set for the buffer in the stack, override any other data of local variables in the stack, then override the rsb and finally inject in the address in the stack that the rip is point to that we want to execute

Example:

Let's consider the following program:

```
void read_password(){
	char password[64];
	FILE* f = fopen("./password.txt","r");
	fgets(password, 64,f);
	fputs(passowrd, stdout);
	fclose(f);
}

int main(){
	char name[64];
	gets(name);
	printf("%s", name);
	return 0;
}

```
Looking the main function we can see that in the stack of the function we have pushed in the rip then the rbp and then the buffer for the var name;

To do an overflow of that buffer we have to fill it with 64 bytes, then override the rsb with 8 more bytes and then the address for the function read_pasword
